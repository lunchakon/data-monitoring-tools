# Prometheus
Time Series Database: Stores and queries time-series data.   
Data Scraper: Periodically polls target systems (like servers, databases, or applications) to collect metrics.   
Alerting System: Triggers alerts based on defined rules and conditions.   

# Grafana
Visualization Platform: Allows you to visualize and analyze time-series data.   
Dashboarding: Creates customizable dashboards with various charts, graphs, and tables.   
Alerting: Configures alerts and notifications based on Prometheus alerts.   

# Node Exporter
Metrics Exporter: Collects metrics about a specific machine, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.   
Prometheus-compatible: Exposes metrics in a format that Prometheus can easily understand and scrape.   

#How They Work Together:

- Node Exporter collects metrics from the system it's running on.   
- Prometheus periodically scrapes these metrics from Node Exporter and stores them in its time-series database.   
- Grafana queries Prometheus to retrieve the stored metrics and displays them in various visualizations.   
- Prometheus can also trigger alerts based on certain metric thresholds, which can be visualized and managed in Grafana.   


# Benefits of Using This Stack:
Comprehensive Monitoring: Provides a holistic view of your infrastructure's health.
Flexible Visualization: Grafana allows you to customize dashboards to your specific needs.   
Powerful Alerting: Prometheus's alerting system enables timely notifications for critical issues.   
Scalability: Both Prometheus and Grafana can scale to handle large-scale monitoring.
Open-Source: The entire stack is open-source, making it free to use and customizable.
